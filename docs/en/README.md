# How to run code in JSBox

- Write code in JSBox directly

  > There's a simple code editor inside JSBox, provides auto completion and syntax highlighting, it will be better in the future

- Get code through URL Scheme

  > For example: jsbox://import?url=url&name=name&icon=icon
  > - Parameters:
  >  - `url`: Code file url
  >  - `name`: The script name
  >  - `icon`: JSBox icon set name, refer: https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko/tree/master/extension-icons
  > - Note:
  >  - Parameters should be URL Encoded
  >  - Please use ASCII characters to naming a URL

- Write code using VSCode extension

  > 1. Open editor settings in JSBox, turn on `Debug Mode`
  > 2. Back to home screen and restart JSBox, switch to the 4th tab to check `Host`
  > 3. Search & install `JSBox` extension in VSCode extension market
  > 4. Open a JavaScript file with VSCode, set host on the menu
  > 5. Now you can write code, and sync it to your iPhone automatically

- AirDrop & Share Sheet

  > You can share a js file with AirDrop to JSBox, but you need to import those files manually.
  > For example you can do that with this script: https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko/blob/master/extension-demos/sync-inbox.js

- Do it yourself! JSBox provides APIs to manage your scripts

  > Here's an example: https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko/blob/master/extension-demos/addin-gallery.js
