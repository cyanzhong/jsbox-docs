# $objc_retain(object)

Sometimes, values generated by Runtime will be released by system automatically, in order to avoid that, you could manage reference yourself:

```js
var manager = $objc("Manager").invoke("new")
$objc_retain(manager)
```

It maintains the object until script stopped.

# $objc_relase(object)

Release a Runtime object manually:

```js
$objc_release(manager)
```
