# Installation

There are tons of ways to install scripts:

- Redirect from xteko website, e.g. https://jsboxbbs.com/d/9
- Share files to JSBox app
- Open file in Safari, launch action extension
- Use web server at the same Wi-Fi
- Use QRCode

If your desktop device is macOS, you can use AirDrop as the most cool way.

PS: All solutions above support `js/zip/box` formats.

# Package Sharing

When you share a package, there're 3 options:

- Share folder
- Share zip file
- Share box file

Share folder to desktop makes you easier to modify, it will be cool to work with VSCode.

Zip files are more likely being used on SNS, box files are basically zip files with `.box` path extensions.
