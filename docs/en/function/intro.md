# Built-in Functions

Besides functions that provided by JavaScript, JSBox offers many extra functions, you can use them globally.

For instance:

```js
var text = $l10n("MAIN_TITLE");
```

This function gives you a localized string.

In order to distinguish them from JavaScript built-in functions, built-in functions provided by JSBox start with `$`.
